# So much more than an annual&nbsp;report

Usually, when you think of annual reports, you might expect a pleasant but dry presentation of organisational achievements. We've been lucky to work with organisations who want to go in another direction, and tell their stories as just that â€“ actual stories.

For ICT Africa's report, 'How Ordinary People Got Connected', we wanted to make the most of the writer's great use of narrative storytelling alongside more conventional report data. The available photographic material was not suitable for print, so we created illustrations to complement the narrative. The result was a beautifully unusual report, with content that could be engaged with on different levels.

For the V&A Waterfront's 'Economic Contribution' report, we could help our clients tell their story with great visual metaphors. We created infographics in an illustration style that resonated with their corporate tone.

For UNCDF we were tasked with designing this very data- and content-heavy report. Using a simple and understated page design, we made the text more user friendly and engaging by including infographics that incorporated illustrated elements.
